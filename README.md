# YouTubeFilter

The YouTube Filter app allows you to use specific filters on YouTube videos,
For example: get all videos with max 50 views and min 20 dislikes.

This can result in some pretty weird, funny and cool YouTube videos.

It's also my first ever app!

The YouTube Data API was not intended for such specific filtering, so if you use a filter like 'max 10 views and min 10 dislikes',
loading might take a while.

If you'd like to use this code, don't forget to replace the gradle property with your own Api key in the class YouTubeFetcher.
